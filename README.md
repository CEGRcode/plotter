#Plotter

Plotter is a web application made for plotting epigenomic data.

###Notes
Standard parameters (meant to emulate Mittal et al. 2022):
* Tag pileup run on 1100 bp windows (to allow data at the x-axis limits to be plotted)
* x-axis limits: -500 to 500
* 100% opacity
* 30 bp sliding window for smoothing
* 0 bp shift
* Lines from composite annotations to plots are 0.5 pixels wide
* Annotation color for yellow (#D7D700) to increase contrast: #AAA200
* Annotation color for off-white (#EBEBEB) to increase contrast: #858585
