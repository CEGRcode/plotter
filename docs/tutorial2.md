1. Click “add entry” to create a new row under IDs
2. Locate the composite files generated from the previous section. Drag and drop each file into their corresponding row. In this session, the files will be sectioned according to their read number.
3. Rename “Composite 0” to “Read 1”, and respectfully for the other section. Changes should be reflected in the legend on the right of the Composite plot.
4. Check off the checkbox “Separate colors for strands.” Change colors for each of the file names so that each file is a different color in the plot. After choosing colors in the wheel, press “enter” on your keyboard to save the changes.
5. Play around with the plot to your desire. In this session, smoothing was changed to 1, and thus the y axis limits changed to achieve a more zoomed-out look.
6. Rename the title and axes to reflect your desired plot. Simply click on the axes to rename, and press enter when done.
7. Once completed, download your plot as an SVG
